Checkmate
=========
###### Version 0.3

Checkmate is a brand new gametype for IW4M.

Two teams, the assassins and the guardians, battle respectively to kill or defend the king.
At the start of a game two players get randomly picked to be the king or first assassin.
The assassins win the game by killing the king while the guardians and king win by surviving.
While the assassins strive to kill the king, they can get more help by killing guardians as they will become assassin too.
The king on the other hand tries to stay alive and can turn assassins into guardians by killing them.

Guardians start with a pistol and with each kill they get a better weapon, the king has a few claymores, a shotgun and a pistol.
The assassins have snipers, the first picked assassin is stronger because of his semtex and stopping power perk.
